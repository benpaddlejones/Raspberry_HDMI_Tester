# Packages to install WITHOUT recommended dependencies
#
# IMPORTANT: Pi-gen INSTALLS packages listed in XX-packages-nr files
# (NOT exclude them - that was the previous misunderstanding)
#
# This file previously contained a list thinking it would exclude packages,
# but pi-gen was actually trying to INSTALL them all. Build succeeded before
# because those packages existed, but failed when 'crda' was removed from
# Debian Bookworm (deprecated - now built into kernel).
#
# Keeping this file EMPTY to avoid installing unnecessary packages.
# Essential packages are already installed in earlier stages.
