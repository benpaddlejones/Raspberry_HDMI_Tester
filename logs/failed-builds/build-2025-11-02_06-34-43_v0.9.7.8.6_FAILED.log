STATUS: FAILED (Build script failed (exit code ))

The build failed before the detailed logging system could complete.
This typically indicates:
- Build failed during early initialization
- Missing directory creation (build/pi-gen-work not created)
- Permission issues with log file path
- Script error before logging initialization

Check the GitHub Actions workflow output for the actual error message.

To debug:
1. View the workflow run logs in GitHub Actions
2. Look for errors in the 'Build Raspberry Pi image' step
3. Check if directories exist and are writable
4. Review validation output if build succeeded but validation failed
