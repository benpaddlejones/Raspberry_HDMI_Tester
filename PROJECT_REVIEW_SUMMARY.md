# Project Review Summary
**Date**: October 17, 2025

## Executive Summary
The Raspberry Pi HDMI Tester project is **25% complete**. The development environment is fully configured, documentation framework is in place, and test assets exist. However, **all core implementation is missing** - no build scripts, no pi-gen stages, and no actual build configuration.

## What's Done ✅
- Development container (Dockerfile, devcontainer.json)
- Comprehensive documentation framework
- Project structure
- Test assets (image + audio)
- pi-gen installed and ready

## What's Missing ❌
- **CRITICAL**: Build configuration (`build/config`)
- **CRITICAL**: All 4 custom pi-gen stages (completely empty)
- **CRITICAL**: All build scripts (scripts/ directory is empty)
- **CRITICAL**: All test scripts (tests/ directory is empty)
- Documentation files (docs/ directory is empty)

## Estimate to Completion
- **Time**: 8-12 hours of focused work
- **Complexity**: Medium (well-defined requirements)
- **Risk**: Low (proven technologies, clear path forward)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Commit Dockerfile fix
2. Create `build/config`
3. Implement 4 custom stages
4. Create build-image.sh
5. Test the build

See `PROJECT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` for detailed step-by-step plan.
