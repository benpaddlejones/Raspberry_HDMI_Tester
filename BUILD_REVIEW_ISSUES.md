## üö® HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. libx264-164 package inconsistency
- **Location**: `build/stage3/00-install-packages/00-packages` (line 27)
- **Issue**: Package is documented as "not needed" and removed from installation list, BUT it's still checked in validation script `00-run-chroot.sh` (line 51)
- **Impact**: Validation script checks for package that was intentionally removed
- **Fix**: Remove `libx264-164` from CODEC_PACKAGES validation list
- **Status**: üîß **FIXED** - Package IS required for H.264/MP4 playback on Pi 3 and earlier. Added to installation list and moved to REQUIRED_PACKAGES validation (not optional). Documentation updated to clarify Pi 3 needs H.264 codec.

### 2. Duplicate file installations (both /opt and /usr/local/bin)
- **Location**: `build/stage3/03-autostart/00-run.sh` (lines 52-90)
- **Issue**: All test scripts installed TWICE - once to `/opt/hdmi-tester/` and once to `/usr/local/bin/`
- **Impact**: Wastes ~200KB disk space, creates maintenance burden (two copies to update)
- **Question**: Are both locations actually needed? Services only use `/opt/hdmi-tester/`
- **Status**: üîß **FIXED** - Scripts now installed ONCE to `/opt/hdmi-tester/` (canonical location used by services) with symlinks created in `/usr/local/bin/` for PATH convenience. Saves ~200KB disk space, eliminates dual maintenance burden.

### 3. MP4 files are deployed but never validated
- **Location**: `build/stage3/01-test-image/files/` contains both `.webm` AND `.mp4` versions
- **Issue**: MP4 files (`image-test.mp4`, `color-test.mp4`) are copied to image but build-time validation only checks WebM files
- **Impact**: Corrupted MP4 files wouldn't be detected until runtime
- **Evidence**: `scripts/build-image.sh` lines 91-92 only validate `.webm` files
- **Status**: üîß **FIXED** - Added comprehensive validation for both MP4 and WebM files in build script. Now validates file existence, size, and codec format (H.264 for MP4, VP9 for WebM). Warns if wrong codec detected but allows build to continue.

### 4. audio.mp3 file exists but uses outdated audio system
- **Location**: `build/stage3/01-test-image/files/audio.mp3`
- **Issue**: Old MP3 audio file still deployed alongside newer FLAC files (stereo.flac, surround51.flac)
- **Impact**: Wastes space (~500KB+), creates confusion about which audio format to use
- **Note**: Only `test-notvideo` script uses audio.mp3, all other services use FLAC
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **VALID - KEEPING** - Audio codecs verified and enhanced:
  - **MP3**: Used by `test-notvideo` (203KB, mp3 32kHz stereo) - KEEPING for this specific test
  - **FLAC**: Used by `audio-test` service (stereo.flac 95KB, surround51.flac 311KB, both 48kHz)
  - **Opus**: Embedded in WebM videos for Pi 4+
  - **AAC**: Embedded in MP4 videos for Pi 3
  - **Added libflac12** to packages for explicit FLAC support
  - **Added libvorbis0a** to validation for WebM Vorbis support
  - All codec packages now validated: MP3, FLAC, AAC (via libavcodec-extra), Opus, Vorbis
  - **Conclusion**: audio.mp3 serves a purpose (test-notvideo), not redundant

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 5. Empty test-download directory
- **Location**: `build/test-download/`
- **Issue**: Directory exists but is completely empty
- **Impact**: Unclear purpose, may be leftover from previous design
- **Suggestion**: Remove if unused or document its purpose
- **Status**: üîß **FIXED** - Directory removed. Investigation showed:
  - No references in any files (scripts, configs, documentation)
  - No git history (never used in project)
  - Created Oct 19, 2025, never populated
  - No .gitkeep or README explaining purpose
  - **Conclusion**: Leftover empty directory, safely removed

### 6. Redundant ROOTFS_DIR safety checks
- **Location**: Three separate files have identical safety check code:
  - `build/stage3/01-test-image/00-run.sh` (lines 12-31)
  - `build/stage3/03-autostart/00-run.sh` (lines 11-30)
  - `build/stage3/04-boot-config/00-run.sh` (lines 11-30)
- **Issue**: Same 20 lines of validation code duplicated in 3 files
- **Suggestion**: Extract to shared function in common file
- **Status**: üîß **FIXED** - Safety checks ARE required and important:
  - Prevents catastrophic damage if ROOTFS_DIR points to host system
  - Validates ROOTFS_DIR is not `/`, system directories, exists, and is writable
  - Created `build/stage3/00-common/validate-rootfs.sh` with shared validation function
  - Updated all 4 stage scripts (01, 02, 03, 04) to source and use common function
  - Reduced duplication from 60+ lines to single shared implementation
  - stage 02 now has comprehensive validation (was minimal before)

### 7. Both config.txt locations handled but not validated
- **Location**: `build/stage3/04-boot-config/00-run.sh` (lines 35-49)
- **Issue**: Script handles `/boot/config.txt` AND `/boot/firmware/config.txt` but doesn't validate which one pi-gen actually creates
- **Impact**: Appends to both files if both exist (redundant, wastes space)
- **Note**: Modern Raspberry Pi OS uses `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
- **Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFERRED - INTENTIONAL** - This is defensive programming:
  - Different Raspberry Pi OS versions use different locations
  - Script checks if config already exists before appending (no duplication)
  - Safe approach: handle both locations for compatibility
  - No actual waste: only one file exists in practice
  - **Conclusion**: Working as intended, provides compatibility

### 8. cmdline.txt modifications are overly aggressive
- **Location**: `build/stage3/04-boot-config/00-run.sh` (lines 105-120)
- **Issue**: Uses multiple sed passes to remove parameters, which is inefficient
- **Suggestion**: Single sed command could handle all removals
- **Status**: üîß **FIXED** - Optimized sed operations:
  - Combined 13 separate `sed -i` invocations into single command
  - Uses multiple `-e` expressions for efficiency
  - Reduces file I/O from 13 operations to 1
  - Maintains same functionality (remove parameters, normalize whitespace)
  - Improves build performance and reduces disk wear

### 9. Stage3 prerun.sh is minimal but unclear
- **Location**: `build/stage3/prerun.sh`
- **Issue**: Only contains `copy_previous` if ROOTFS_DIR doesn't exist - no documentation why
- **Impact**: Unclear if this is actually needed or leftover from pi-gen template
- **Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFERRED - PI-GEN REQUIREMENT** - This is required by pi-gen:
  - `copy_previous` ensures stage3 starts with stage2's filesystem
  - Standard pi-gen pattern (all stages need prerun.sh)
  - Removing would break the build
  - **Conclusion**: Required infrastructure, leave as-is

## üìä LOW PRIORITY / INFORMATIONAL

### 10. Test images (PNG files) deployed but only image.png is actively used
- **Location**: `build/stage3/01-test-image/files/` contains: black.png, blue.png, green.png, red.png, white.png, image.png
- **Issue**: 6 PNG files deployed, but only `image-test` script uses them (image.png used by test-notvideo)
- **Impact**: Each PNG ~50-200KB, total ~600KB for rarely-used test pattern rotation
- **Note**: These ARE used by `image-test` script but that service is disabled by default
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 11. Two video formats supported but build only validates one
- **Location**: Scripts auto-detect Pi model to choose WebM (Pi 4+) vs MP4 (Pi 3)
- **Issue**: WebM validated during build, MP4 assumed to work
- **Impact**: Pi 3 users might get untested MP4 files
- **Evidence**: `scripts/build-image.sh` doesn't validate MP4 codec compatibility
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 12. Memory limit syntax deprecation warning
- **Location**: All service files use `MemoryLimit=512M`
- **Issue**: `MemoryLimit=` is deprecated in favor of `MemoryMax=`
- **Impact**: Works but generates systemd warnings in logs
- **Fix**: Replace `MemoryLimit=` with `MemoryMax=` in all .service files
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 13. GitHub Actions workflow duplicates image search logic
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`
- **Issue**: Lines 649-668 (validation) and lines 760+ (QEMU test) have nearly identical image file search code
- **Suggestion**: Extract to reusable step or bash function
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 14. Build cleanup happens AFTER image validation
- **Location**: `scripts/build-image.sh` lines 562-599 (cleanup) vs lines 502-530 (validation)
- **Issue**: Cleanup removes intermediate files that might be useful for debugging validation failures
- **Suggestion**: Move cleanup to end of script (after all validation)
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 15. FLAC files in wrong directory
- **Location**: FLAC files in `assets/` AND `build/stage3/02-audio-test/files/`
- **Issue**: Duplicated storage - both locations contain stereo.flac and surround51.flac
- **Impact**: ~40MB duplicated (20MB each file x2 copies)
- **Note**: Build uses files from `build/stage3/02-audio-test/files/`, assets/ copy seems unused
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

## üö® CRITICAL - NEWLY DISCOVERED

### ‚ùå CMDLINE.TXT CORRUPTION BY RASPBERRY PI OS (CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE)
- **Location**: `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` on deployed Pi
- **Issue**: Raspberry Pi OS firmware/firstboot scripts MODIFY cmdline.txt AFTER our image boots
- **Impact**: CATASTROPHIC - This is why videos crash:
  1. **ENTIRE cmdline duplicated** (all parameters appear twice)
  2. **HDMI audio DISABLED**: `snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=0` added by firmware
  3. **Conflicting parameters**: `snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0` then `=1`
  4. **Memory management broken**: `cgroup_disable=memory` re-added (we removed this)
  5. **Firmware params added**: `coherent_pool`, `vc_mem.mem_base`, `vc_mem.mem_size`
- **Evidence**: Diagnostic report from Pi 3 shows:
  ```
  Line 1: console=... snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 ... [CORRECT - from our build]
  Line 2: coherent_pool=1M ... snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=0 ... [FIRMWARE ADDED - WRONG!]
  ```
- **Root Cause**:
  - Our build script correctly configures cmdline.txt
  - Raspberry Pi OS resize/firstboot scripts run AFTER first boot
  - These scripts APPEND their own parameters without checking for conflicts
  - Result: duplicated content, conflicting values, HDMI audio disabled
- **Status**: üîß **FIX COMPLETED - NEEDS HARDWARE TESTING** - Created fix-cmdline.service:
  - Oneshot service runs ONCE on first boot (sysinit.target)
  - After `systemd-remount-fs.service` and `local-fs.target`
  - Before `sysinit.target` and `basic.target` (runs very early)
  - Removes ALL duplicate parameters
  - Removes ALL conflicting firmware additions
  - Re-applies correct HDMI audio configuration
  - Creates `/var/lib/hdmi-tester/cmdline-fixed` marker
  - Logs to `/var/log/fix-cmdline.log`
  - **AUTOMATIC REBOOT**: Triggers system reboot after cleanup
  - **Boot sequence**:
    1. First boot: RPi OS corrupts cmdline.txt during resize
    2. fix-cmdline.service runs, cleans corruption, triggers reboot
    3. Second boot: Kernel reads CORRECT cmdline.txt
    4. HDMI audio works, services start normally
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è MUST TEST**: Flash image to Pi, allow automatic first boot + reboot cycle, verify cmdline.txt correct

## ü§î UNCLEAR / NEEDS CLARIFICATION

### 16. What is the purpose of arm_freq=1000 in config.txt?
- **Location**: `build/stage3/04-boot-config/00-run.sh` appends `arm_freq=1000`
- **Issue**: Called "conservative overclock" but 1000MHz is actually **UNDERCLOCK** for Pi 4 (default 1500MHz)
- **Question**: Is this intentional for stability or an error?
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 17. Why are services disabled by default?
- **Location**: `build/stage3/03-autostart/00-run.sh` line 128
- **Issue**: Comment says "intentionally NOT enabled for manual testing phase"
- **Question**: Is this temporary or permanent design decision? Makes "auto-start" stage name misleading
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 18. tune2fs deferred to first boot - will it actually run?
- **Location**: `build/stage3/04-boot-config/00-run-chroot.sh` creates `tune-filesystem.service`
- **Issue**: Service runs once on first boot to optimize filesystem
- **Question**: Has this been tested? Does the service actually trigger?
- **Impact**: If it fails silently, filesystem optimizations never applied
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 19. Multiple logging locations
- **Issue**: Scripts log to different locations:
  - Build: `build/pi-gen-work/build-detailed.log`
  - Runtime tests: `/tmp/hdmi-test.log`, `/tmp/pixel-test.log`, etc.
  - Archived: `logs/build-TIMESTAMP.log`
- **Question**: Is this intentional organization or historical artifact?
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 20. Stage2 packages removal list may be overly aggressive
- **Location**: `build/stage2/01-sys-tweaks/00-packages-nr`
- **Issue**: Removes 40+ packages including some that might be useful (htop, rsync, man-db)
- **Question**: Has this been tested to ensure nothing breaks? Some removed packages might be dependencies
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

---

## üì¶ POTENTIAL OPTIMIZATIONS

### 21. Image file duplication in assets/
- **Files in assets/**: All test videos, images, audio exist there AND in build/stage3/
- **Impact**: ~50MB duplicated data in repository
- **Suggestion**: Keep files ONLY in build/stage3/{01,02}-*/files/, remove from assets/
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 22. Both WebM and MP4 formats increase image size
- **Impact**: Each video format pair ~2.5MB, both formats = ~5MB total
- **Question**: Could we include ONLY WebM and convert to MP4 at runtime for Pi 3? (Saves ~2.5MB)
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

### 23. Validation script creates large log files
- **Location**: Test scripts use verbose VLC output (`-vv`)
- **Impact**: Log files can grow to 10MB+ during extended testing
- **Suggestion**: Add log rotation or size limits
- **Status**: ‚ùì PENDING VALIDATION

## üìù NOTES

- This review was automated - human validation required
- Some "issues" may be intentional design decisions that need documentation
- Priority levels are suggestions, adjust based on project needs
- Review date: October 25, 2025
- **Last updated**: October 25, 2025 - Added critical cmdline.txt corruption issue

## üî¥ BLOCKING ISSUES (MUST TEST BEFORE NEXT RELEASE)

1. **cmdline.txt corruption** - ‚úÖ FIX IMPLEMENTED, ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS HARDWARE TESTING:
   - Fix is complete and committed
   - Service runs on first boot, cleans cmdline.txt, triggers automatic reboot
   - Second boot will have correct parameters
   - **CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED**:
     - Flash fresh image to Raspberry Pi
     - Allow first boot to complete (will auto-reboot)
     - After second boot, SSH in and check `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`
     - Verify NO duplicates, NO `snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=0`, NO `cgroup_disable=memory`
     - Check `/var/log/fix-cmdline.log` for service execution details
     - Verify `/var/lib/hdmi-tester/cmdline-fixed` marker exists
     - Test video playback works correctly

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES (Implemented, awaiting build/test)

1. ‚úÖ libx264-164 package - Added and validated
2. ‚úÖ Duplicate file installations - Using symlinks now
3. ‚úÖ MP4 validation - Both WebM and MP4 validated
4. ‚úÖ Audio codec support - All formats verified
5. ‚úÖ Empty test-download directory - Removed
6. ‚úÖ ROOTFS_DIR validation - Extracted to shared function
7. ‚úÖ cmdline.txt sed optimization - Single command now
8. ‚úÖ cmdline.txt corruption fix - Service created with automatic reboot (NEEDS HARDWARE TEST)

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

1. **üî¥ CRITICAL - Build new image** with cmdline.txt fix
2. **üî¥ CRITICAL - Test on actual Pi hardware**:
   - Flash image to SD card
   - Boot Pi (will auto-reboot after cmdline fix)
   - Verify cmdline.txt correct after second boot
   - Verify HDMI audio works
   - Verify videos play without crashing
3. **Validate remaining 14 pending issues** (LOW priority)
4. **Address issue #10-23** as time permits (mostly optimizations)
5. **If fix works**: Release v1.0.0 with working video playback
6. **If fix fails**: Investigate alternative approaches (prevent RPi OS from modifying cmdline.txt)
