# Raspberry Pi HDMI Tester

A plug-and-play Raspberry Pi SD card image that automatically displays a test pattern and plays audio through HDMI. Perfect for quickly testing displays, troubleshooting HDMI connections, and verifying A/V equipment.

## What Is This?

This is a ready-to-use Raspberry Pi image that:
- ‚úÖ **Boots automatically** - No keyboard, mouse, or interaction needed
- ‚úÖ **Displays a test pattern** - Full HD 1920x1080 test image
- ‚úÖ **Plays continuous audio** - Audio loops infinitely through HDMI
- ‚úÖ **Boots in ~30 seconds** - Fast startup for quick testing
- ‚úÖ **Works on any Pi** - Compatible with Pi 3, 4, 5, Zero 2 W

Simply flash it to an SD card, insert it into a Raspberry Pi, connect HDMI, and power on!

## Quick Start

### What You Need

**Hardware**:
- Raspberry Pi (any model with HDMI output)
- MicroSD card (4GB minimum, 8GB recommended)
- Power supply for your Pi
- HDMI cable
- Display with HDMI input

**Software**:
- The HDMI Tester image (download from [Releases](https://github.com/benpaddlejones/Raspberry_HDMI_Tester/releases))
- Flashing tool (Raspberry Pi Imager recommended)

### Step 1: Download the Image

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/benpaddlejones/Raspberry_HDMI_Tester/releases)
2. Download `RaspberryPi_HDMI_Tester.img.zip`
3. Extract the `.img` file from the ZIP

### Step 2: Flash to SD Card

Choose your operating system for detailed instructions:

- **[Windows 10/11](docs/FLASHING-Windows.md)** - Detailed guide for Windows users
- **[macOS](docs/FLASHING-macOS.md)** - Complete macOS instructions
- **[Linux](docs/FLASHING-Linux.md)** - Linux flashing guide

**Quick method** (all platforms):
1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Click "Choose OS" ‚Üí "Use custom" ‚Üí Select the `.img` file
3. Click "Choose Storage" ‚Üí Select your SD card
4. Click "Write"

### Step 3: Boot and Test

1. **Insert SD card** into Raspberry Pi
2. **Connect HDMI cable** to your display
3. **Connect power supply**
4. **Wait ~30 seconds** for boot

**You should see**:
- ‚úÖ Green LED blinks on the Pi
- ‚úÖ Test pattern appears on screen (1920x1080)
- ‚úÖ Audio plays continuously through HDMI

**That's it!** Your HDMI tester is working.

## What You'll See

### Test Pattern
The default test pattern displays:
- Full HD resolution (1920x1080)
- Color information
- Resolution details
- Visual reference for display testing

### Audio Output
- Continuous audio playback through HDMI
- Loops infinitely (no user interaction needed)
- Tests both HDMI video and audio simultaneously

## Customization

Want to use your own test pattern or audio? See the [Customization Guide](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for:
- Replacing the test pattern image
- Using custom audio files
- Changing HDMI resolution settings
- Modifying boot behavior

## Troubleshooting

### No Display?

**Check these first**:
- ‚úÖ HDMI cable is firmly connected
- ‚úÖ Display is powered on and set to correct input
- ‚úÖ Display supports 1920x1080 resolution
- ‚úÖ Try a different HDMI cable

### No Audio?

**Common fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Enable HDMI audio in your TV/monitor settings
- ‚úÖ Increase volume on the display
- ‚úÖ Some displays default to internal speakers - switch to HDMI audio
- ‚úÖ Try a different HDMI port

### Pi Won't Boot?

**Symptoms**: Only red LED, no green activity

**Try these solutions**:
1. **Re-flash the SD card** - Image may be corrupted
2. **Try a different SD card** - Some cards are incompatible
3. **Use a quality SD card** (SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston)
4. **Verify your power supply** - Insufficient power can cause issues
