Recommended Fixes
Fix 1: Detect pi-gen failures properly (Must do first)

Parse pi-gen output for Build failed message
Don't rely solely on exit code
Fix 2: Handle missing packages (One of these options):

Option A: Override stage2/01-sys-tweaks/00-packages to remove unavailable packages
Option B: Add SKIP file to stage2 to skip it entirely (risky)
Option C: Check if we're using the wrong Raspberry Pi OS release/repo
Next Steps Recommendation
Would you like me to:

Fix the exit code detection bug so failures are properly caught?
Investigate which Raspberry Pi OS release should have these packages?
Create a workaround to skip these problematic packages?
