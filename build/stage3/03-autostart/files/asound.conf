# This file is part of the Raspberry Pi HDMI Tester project.

# It forces the default ALSA audio device to be the first HDMI
# output (card 1). This is a simpler, more robust approach
# based on common troubleshooting steps for Raspberry Pi HDMI audio.
#
# The vc4-hdmi driver typically registers as card 1.
# Card 0 is usually the bcm2835 (headphone jack).
#
# This configuration replaces a more complex, dynamic setup to resolve
# a persistent "ENODEV" (device not found) error.
