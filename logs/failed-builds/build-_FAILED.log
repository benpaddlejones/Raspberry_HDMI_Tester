STATUS: FAILED EARLY (before detailed log could be created)

The build failed before the detailed logging system could initialize.
This typically indicates:
- Missing directory creation (build/pi-gen-work not created)
- Permission issues with log file path
- Script error before logging initialization

Check the GitHub Actions workflow output for the actual error message.

To debug:
1. View the workflow run logs in GitHub Actions
2. Look for errors in the 'Build Raspberry Pi image' step
3. Check if directories exist and are writable
