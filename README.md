2. **Connect HDMI cable** to your display
3. **Connect power supply**
4. **Wait ~30 seconds** for boot

**You should see**:
- ‚úÖ Green LED blinks on the Pi
- ‚úÖ Test pattern appears on screen (1920x1080)
- ‚úÖ Audio plays continuously through HDMI

**That's it!** Your HDMI tester is working.

## What You'll See

### Test Pattern
The default test pattern displays:
- Full HD resolution (1920x1080)
- Color information
- Resolution details
- Visual reference for display testing

### Audio Output
- Continuous audio playback through HDMI
- Loops infinitely (no user interaction needed)
- Tests both HDMI video and audio simultaneously

## Customization

Want to use your own test pattern or audio? See the [Customization Guide](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for:
- Replacing the test pattern image
- Using custom audio files
- Changing HDMI resolution settings
- Modifying boot behavior

## Troubleshooting

### No Display?

**Check these first**:
- ‚úÖ HDMI cable is firmly connected
- ‚úÖ Display is powered on and set to correct input
- ‚úÖ Display supports 1920x1080 resolution
- ‚úÖ Try a different HDMI cable

### No Audio?

**Common fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Enable HDMI audio in your TV/monitor settings
- ‚úÖ Increase volume on the display
- ‚úÖ Some displays default to internal speakers - switch to HDMI audio
- ‚úÖ Try a different HDMI port

### Pi Won't Boot?

**Symptoms**: Only red LED, no green activity

**Try these solutions**:
1. **Re-flash the SD card** - Image may be corrupted
2. **Try a different SD card** - Some cards are incompatible
3. **Use a quality SD card** (SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston)
4. **Verify your power supply** - Insufficient power can cause issues
